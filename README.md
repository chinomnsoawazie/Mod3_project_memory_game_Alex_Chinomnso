Welcome to ShapesBlaster Game where you learn how smart you are at remembering instructions. Here are a few things you should keep in mind.

- We don't like losers. In other words, losers *shall* be made to lose more, so if you lose at a level, we take you one level behind. Yes, you can deep into bankruptcy. Good news however is that you can claw your way out of that hole. Hope that's very encouraging young padawan.

- You are provided a freebie points bounty card. Put in the work and figure it out.

- You have instructions on what to pop at each level. Let's see how well you learnt how to listen to instructions from your mama.




This game is about dragging a slider to pop falling shapes and goes from level to level
